          I first visited Hoi An in 2005 in what was my first trip to Southeast Asia. With three weeks in the country it
          was a quick trip in comparison to how I travel now. I can barely remember what I thought of Hoi An on that
          trip.

          I travelled without a laptop (which seems incomprehensible to me now) and looking back at my photos it appears
          that I hardly took any.
